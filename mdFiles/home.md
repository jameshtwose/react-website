### Home
Welcome to the home page of the website. This is a website created using the React Javascript Framework. This website is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about React. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and the source code is available on GitHub. The website is built using the create-react-app package. The website uses the mdbootstrap react package and the fontawesome package.
